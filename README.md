## What
- A 2m\*2m booth in the main hall with a 1.5m\*0.3m table and a chair (or two). We need to supply everything else.
- Antenna(s) and optionally a radio shack on the field. We need to supply everything.

## What we intend to show
- (Royce) A loop antenna with an LED and handheld transceiver demonstrating the shape and variability of a transmitter's RF field.
- (Roland) An interpretive sign: what amateur radio is, why it's interesting, etc.
- (Darryl) A basic rig. Perhaps merely for show indoors, perhaps indoors and connected to an outdoor antenna (a cable run has been proposed but neither approved nor refused), perhaps outdoors connected to an antenna.
- (Roland) Wire antenna suitable for HF use, making sensible use of buildings, and perhaps balloon-hoisting. (Roland to file CAAS notice in the latter case.)
- If we can find volunteers to provide the pieces: an HF rig with a 300W linear amplifier and suitable antenna match.

## What we'll need
- A roster of people to man the booth(s).
- HF gear.
- Balloon(s). Lightning arrestor.
- Probably a tent.
- Volunteers to help on set-up/tear-down.
