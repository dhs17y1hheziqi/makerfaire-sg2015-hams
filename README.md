## What
- A 2m\*2m booth in the main hall with a 1.5m\*0.3m table and a chair (or two). We need to supply everything else.
- Antenna(s) and optionally a radio shack on the field. We need to supply everything.

## What we intend to show
- (Royce) A loop antenna with an LED and handheld transceiver demonstrating the shape and variability of a transmitter's RF field.
- (Roland) An interpretive sign: what amateur radio is, why it's interesting, etc.
- If we can find volunteers to provide the pieces: an HF rig with a 300W linear amplifier and suitable antenna match.
- TODO Nail this list down; additional unstructured items are fine, this is about the prepared exhibits. For the indoor element, bear space constraints in mind. N.B. BYO Internet.

## What we'll need
- Extension lead, ELCB/RCD for outdoor exhibit
- Objectives for pull-up banner to encourage passers by with exhbition fatigue to stop and talk (WHO?) -> artwork (WHO?) -> printing (Roland) -> delivery (WHO?)
